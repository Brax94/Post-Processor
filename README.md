# Post-Processor
WARNING: This project is a work in progress, and should be treated as such. Be careful when testing. 


Visual Components to Kuka KR C4 KRL Post Processor, created for my master thesis at NTNU. Open Source, feel free to use the code however you like! 


Usage: Put PostProcessor.py in your documents\VisualComponents\4.0\MyCommands folder.  In a visual components python script, simply import PostProcessor, instanciate it with a name and a folder location for where you want your .src file to be created. With the instantiated class, run the process method with the routine you wish to process, and then the close method when you are finished.
